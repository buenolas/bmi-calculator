## BMI Calculator Project

This project is a simple web application to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI). The application consists of an HTML file for structure, a CSS file for styling, and a JavaScript file for functionality. Users can input their name, height, and weight to compute their BMI and receive a message indicating their weight category.

### Project Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the BMI calculator.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the BMI calculator.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for calculating BMI and displaying the result.

### How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter your name, height (in meters), and weight (in kilograms).
4. Click the "Compute" button to calculate your BMI and see the result.

### Files
